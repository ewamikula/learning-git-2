			<h2>Drumming song</h2>
			<h3>Florence and The Machine</h3>
			<p class="one">There's a drumming noise inside my head<br>That starts when you're around<br>I swear that you could hear it<br>It makes such an almighty sound<br>There's a drumming noise inside my head<br>That throws me to the ground<br>I swear that you should hear it<br>It makes such an almighty sound
			</p>
			<p class="two">I ran to a tower where the church bells chime<br>I hoped that they would clear my mind<br>They left a ringing in my ear<br>But that drum's still beating loud and clear</p>
			<p class="three">Louder than sirens<br>Louder than bells<br>Sweeter than heaven<br>And hotter than hell</p>
